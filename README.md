# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Motivation
Customer churn is one of the most pressing challenges in the banking industry. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, yet many banks struggle to identify which clients are at risk of leaving. By predicting churn in advance, banks can take proactive measures—such as personalized offers, improved services, or targeted engagement—to reduce attrition and increase customer lifetime value.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that analyzes customer behavior and demographic data to predict churn. The goal is to provide banks with actionable insights that support data-driven retention strategies and ultimately improve business profitability.

## Dataset
We discovered the "Bank Customer Churn" dataset on Kaggle and found out that it could be a perfect data because of several factors. It contains several finance-related features, which could identify the customer profile and display its relationship to the churn likelihood. The data is at the right amount: with 18 columns and 10,000 rows, which are perfect for machine learning model training. Moreover, the data is perfectly cleaned, which is immediately, again, suitable for model training in some levels.
